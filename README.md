# Yet another html numeric input, hope it's awesome
A textbox only allows visitor to type numeric, dot, and minus sign. This will replace the half-ass HTML5 input type=number

A working sample is here https://rawgit.com/lockevn/html-numeric-input/master/index.html

 
 - Support positive and negative number
 - Support decimal number (with dot)
 - This is vanilla JS, no library required
 - Tested on Chrome, Firefox, IE10, IE11
 - Tested on Windows, the keycodes is taken from http://keycode.info
